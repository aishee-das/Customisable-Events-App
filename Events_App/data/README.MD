In order for the program to function correctly, we need to have the file 'scotland-latest.osm.pbf' downloaded and present in this file.
For the sake of being able to upload to Github correctly, I have omitted this file as part of the push. 
Therefore, when working on your implementations and want to test, I recommend you download the file locally and put it in the /data folder
It should also have the same name: 'scotland-latest.osm.pbf'.
You can download the file at the following link:
